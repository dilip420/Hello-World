In this use case we are using ML expertise to help the company make the right decision. Fyantra is largest online clothing company in USA. It sells clothing online,
but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come into the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then can go home 
and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
Company wants to decide whether to focus the effort on mobile app experience or its website. As a drastic measure it is also evaluating to shut down the website.

We'll work with the FyntraCustomerData.csv. It has Customer info, such as Email, Address. Then it also has numerical value columns:

Avg_Session_Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time_on_App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time_on_Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length_of_Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
Yearly_Amount_Spent: The output parameter -- Amount Spend in thousand $ in a year
